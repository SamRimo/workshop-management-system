<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The Resource Manager works with a single resources file in the WorMS folder,
which stores the resource records. Upon opening this form for the first time or
after changing the file directory, you are likely to be presented with an empty window:</p>

<img src="images/Resource_manager_2.gif" alt="Empty Resource Manager window" />

<p>The information in the list box to the right is to indicate that the program has found
no records on the resources file.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: If the resources file was to be deleted or tampered with,
some or all records on the actual file could be ignored. Please see Troubleshooting for
more details if resources you have previously saved cannot be found.</p>

<p>The only button available will be the Add Category button. Upon clicking it, an input
box to enter a new category will appear.</p>

<img src="images/Resource_manager_3.gif" alt="Enter New Category dialog" />

<p>Clicking Cancel will stop the category from being added. Clicking OK will validate
your input and add the new category to the category selector if correct, ready for
resources in that category to be added.</p>

<img src="images/Resource_manager_4.gif" alt="New Category added" />

<p>Now that a category has been added, data can be input into Select Resource
to add new resources in the category created.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: Any categories added without resources will not be saved to
the records file when the Resource Manager is closed.</p>

<p>Upon adding a new resource, a record for that resource is stored on file and added
to the resource list. The data input in Select Resource is then cleared. Data from
an existing resource can be viewed and changed by simply selecting it in the resource
list.</p>

<img src="images/Resource_manager_5.gif" alt="Resource data view" />

<p>When making a change to resource stock, the student responsible for the change can
be selected in the student responsible selector. There must be students in the students
file in order for them to appear.</p>

<img src="images/Resource_manager_6.gif" alt="Student responsible selector opened" />

<p>Of course, any time a student is not responsible or a resource has been restocked,
the None option can be selected.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: Remember to click Change or press enter each time data in a
resource is modified since clicking away from the selected resource will mean data
input is lost if it has not already been saved.</p>

<p>Clicking on the category selector will open a list of categories the user has
created.</p>

<img src="images/Resource_manager_7.gif" alt="Category selector opened" />

<p>As stated before, when the Resource Manager is reopened this list will only
retain those categories that have resources associated with them.</p>

<p>Upon selecting a resource in the resource list, the remove resource button is
also enabled so the user can remove the selected resource. A confirmation will
appear upon clicking the button and selecting Yes will remove that resource
from file.</p>

<p>While a category is selected, the remove category button will be enabled. Upon
clicking the button, a confirmation will appear. Selecting Yes will remove the
selected category and its contents (if any) from file.</p>
