<p>This form is used to manage suppliers for usage in requisition forms and track their
usage.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Name text box</b> - used to view or enter a name of a supplier</li>
	<li><b>Times used spin box</b> - used to view or enter the number of times a 
	supplier has been used</li>
	<li><b>Address text box</b> - used to view or enter a supplier's address</li>
	<li><b>Add/Change button</b> - used to add a new supplier with the information 
	entered or to change the information of one selected in the list</li>
	<li><b>Clear button</b> - used to clear the supplier list selection and any data
	entry</li>
	<li><b>Remove button</b> - used to remove the currently selected supplier</li>
	<li><b>Supplier list box</b> - used to select a supplier already on file to view or 
	change its contents or delete it altogether; suppliers are always in decreasing order
	of times used</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>On opening the Supplier Manager for the first time or after changing the folder 
location, you are likely to be presented with an empty window:</p>

<img src="images/Supplier_manager_2.gif" alt="Empty Supplier Manager window" />

<p>The information in the list box to the right is to indicate that the program has found
no records on the suppliers file.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: If the suppliers file was to be deleted or tampered with,
some or all records on the actual file could be ignored. Please see Troubleshooting for
more details if suppliers you have previously saved cannot be found.</p>

<p>To add your first supplier to list, simply input the supplier name and address in the 
boxes on the left and click Add when finished. The times used can be changed if you wish 
but this optional as it will be handled by the program automatically.</p>

<p>Selecting a record in the list will make its contents appear in the boxes on the left, 
where it can be viewed and changed by making changes and clicking the Change button. The 
supplier may also be removed by clicking the Remove button.</p>

<p>Any time an unprinted final requisition form is exported to Excel through the 
<a href="Help_frmReqMan.html">Requisition Form Manager</a> to become a printed final 
form, the times used of the supplier associated with it will increment and the suppliers will 
sort as appropriate to represent the supplier 'hierarchy'. If a form has already been printed, 
the times used for that supplier will not update further.</p>
