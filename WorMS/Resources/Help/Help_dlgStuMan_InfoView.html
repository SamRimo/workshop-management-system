<h1>View/Edit Student Information</h1>

<img src="images/Edit_student_info_1.gif" alt="Add Student dialog" />

<p>This dialog is used to enter information to add a new student or to view or change
the information of an existing student. This information includes their name, level, 
whether they have paid, whether they have had a receipt printed and what resources they 
have used.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Name text box</b> - used to add or view a student's name; once a student's
	name is saved, it is permanent and cannot be changed unless a new student is 
	created to replace the old student record</li>
	<li><b>Level selector</b> - used to select the level the student is in their
	A-level studies</li>
	<li><b>Cost owed text box</b> - used to enter the cost a student owes; this value
	can be 0 if the student owes no money</li>
	<li><b>Paid radio buttons</b> - used to select whether the student has paid or 
	not</li>
	<li><b>Receipt printed radio buttons</b> - used to select whether the student has
	had their receipt printed or not; this value is handled automatically but can 
	be changed manually if needed</li>
	<li><b>Resources list box</b> - used to list the resources a student has used, 
	based from entry through the <a href="Help_frmResMan.html">Resource Manager</a></li>
	<li><b>Clear button</b> - used to deselect the current resource selection on the list</li>
	<li><b>Remove button</b> - used to remove the resource selected on the list</li>
	<li><b>OK button</b> - used to enter the input into the program and perform the action
	selected earlier</li>
	<li><b>Cancel button</b> - used to cancel any input entered; the action selected earlier 
	will not be taken</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>When a student is to be added, the parts on the top of the dialog can be used to add the 
student's name, level, cost owed, whether they have paid and whether they have had their 
receipt printed. Resources can only be added to the student's record through the Resource 
Manager, once the student has been added.</p>

<p>When a student is to be changed, any of the information can be changed except for the 
student's name. Resources in the resource list can be selected and removed if needed, by 
clicking the Remove button below the list.</p>

<img src="images/Edit_student_info_3.gif" alt="Select Student Resource" />

<p>Upon clicking View Info for a selected student in the 
<a href="Help_frmStuMan.html">Student Manager</a>, the student's information can only be 
viewed through the dialog.</p>

<p>Clicking Cancel at any time will return the user to the Student Manager and no actions will 
be applied concerning information input. Clicking OK will mean the information input will apply 
as selected.</p>
