<p><br /></p>

<p class="note">NOTE: The Requisition Form editor requires suppliers added through the 
<a href="Help_frmSupMan.html">Supplier Manager</a> to be available prior to opening. If 
this is not fulfilled, an error message will appear and the user will be brought to the 
<a href="Help_frmHomeScreen.html">Home Screen</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Usage from Home Screen</h2>

<p>Upon clicking Add New Requisition Form from the Home Screen, with suppliers available, 
a blank requisition form will be opened ready for input.</p>

<img src="images/Requisition_form_editor_2.gif" alt="Empty Requisition Form Editor window" />

<p>Clicking the supplier selector on the top-left of the form will retrieve the suppliers 
on file and display them in a list, each with the number of times they have been used
in brackets.</p>

<img src="images/Requisition_form_editor_3.gif" alt="Supplier selector opened" />

<p>Selecting a supplier will automatically fill in the address text box below with the
selected supplier's address, as stored on file. The rest of the requisition form can be
completed with requested resources, reasons for a new supplier, benefits from a new
supplier and the authorised department manager.</p>

<p>Upon clicking Add New Resource and filling out the information for a new resource in
the Add/Edit Requested Resource dialog, the resource is added to the resource list.
Selecting an item will allow you to make changes to it through the Change Resource button 
or remove it entirely through the Remove Selected button. To enable the Add New Resource
button again after selecting a resource, click the Clear Selection button.</p>

<h2>Usage from View Low Stock Dialog</h2>

<p>If a new requisition form is created with resources selected from the 
<a href="Help_dlgResMan_LowStockView.html">View Low Stock</a> dialog, they will 
automatically be added to the resource list and can be changed by selecting them and 
clicking the Change  Resource button for each. It is mandatory that all resources in the 
list contain a catalogue number for the form to be saved at all.</p>

<h2>Usage from Requisition Form Manager</h2>

<p>When a previously saved requisition form is selected to be reused or changed, its
contents are automatically added to a new requisition form. This means that if the form 
is saved as a draft or final, it will be saved alongside the old file.</p>

<p>Any time a previously saved requisition form's supplier cannot be found in the
suppliers file, the requisition form's supplier will appear as blank. In this situation,
the form can still be changed and then saved as a draft so the supplier needed can be
added through the Supplier Manager and used in the form when it is opened again.</p>
