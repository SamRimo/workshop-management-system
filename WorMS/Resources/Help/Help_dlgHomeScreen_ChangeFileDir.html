<h1>Change File Directory</h1>

<img src="images/Change_file_directory_1.gif" alt="Change file directory dialog" />

<p>This dialog is used to change where data files are stored for the program to use.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Browse button</b> - opens a folder selection window so a new location 
	for files can be given</li>
	<li><b>OK button</b> - assigns the selected folder location to the whole of the 
	program; new folders we be copied to the location</li>
	<li><b>Cancel button</b> - cancels any input entered; the folder location will 
	remain the same as it was before</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>If the user wishes to change where the program files are saved, perhaps not wanting 
them saved onto their personal documents folder, a new location for those files can be 
found and assigned by clicking Browse, finding the folder and clicking OK to apply 
changes. If no existing data exists in the selected location, all parts of the program 
will be cleared of any data.</p>

<p>Folders with existing data, including those placed in the user's documents folder, can 
selected and they will be read again. When a folder is selected not containing a WorMS 
folder, a new one will be created and assigned. When selecting an existing folder, the folder
itself will be assigned.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: Due to technical limitations, whenever the program is opened it will 
always assign the folder location to the user's documents as default. Any time the user 
wishes to keep using a different folder for files, it must be selected through this dialog 
first upon starting the program.</p>
