<h1>Student Manager</h1>

<img src="images/Student_manager_1.gif" alt="Student Manager window" />

<p>This form is used to manage student records and the resources they have 
used. Receipts can also be printed for students who have paid what they owe 
in the costs of using resources.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Student list box</b> - used to view students and select them 
	to change their information, view their information in more detail, 
	remove them altogether or add to collection of students for receipt 
	printing</li>
	<li><b>Add/Change Student button</b> - used to add a new student when 
	no current students are selected or change the student currently 
	selected</li>
	<li><b>View Info button</b> - used to view the information of a student 
	in more detail; changes to information cannot be made in this mode</li>
	<li><b>Remove Student button</b> - used to remove the currently selected 
	student and their record of resources used (if any) from file</li>
	<li><b>Print Receipt(s)</b> - used to print receipts for the students 
	selected in the student list box; the user will be notified if any of 
	the students selected has not yet paid or already had their receipt 
	printed to prevent error</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Upon starting the program for the first time or after changing the folder 
where data is saved, you will likely be presented with a message stating no 
student records could be found.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: If the students file or any student resource log files were to be 
deleted or tampered with, some or all records on the actual file could be ignored. 
Please see Troubleshooting for more details if students or a student's resources you have 
previously saved cannot be found.</p>

<p>The first student may be added through the 
<a href="Help_dlgStuMan_InfoView.html">View/Edit Student Information</a> dialog, which is 
triggered by clicking the Add Student button. After adding a student, it will appear in the 
student list box once you return to the Student Manager.</p>

<p>More students can be added after this if required.</p>

<p>Selecting one student in the list will enable the Change Student, View Info and Remove 
Student buttons.</p>

<img src="images/Student_manager_4.gif" alt="One student selected" />

<p>Clicking Change Student will allow you to view and change information associated 
with the student selected through the View/Edit Student Information dialog once again. 
Clicking View Info will trigger the same dialog but information will only be viewable. 
Clicking Remove Student will remove the selected student and their resource log, if any, 
from file. Print Receipt(s) can also be clicked to print a single receipt for this 
student, although it would be more sensible to print receipts for multiple receipts to 
save paper (see below).</p>

<p>If multiple students are selected by dragging the mouse across multiple items or by holding
the Ctrl key and clicking students individually, they will not all be able to be changed, viewed 
or removed collectively. However, the print receipt(s) button will be enabled to print receipts 
for the selected students.</p>

<img src="images/Student_manager_5.gif" alt="Multiple students selected" />

<p>Clicking the Print Receipt(s) button will generate a print preview of the student's 
receipts, which feature spaces for handout number and signature, as well as the current 
date, their name and the cost paid, all placed automatically.</p>

<img src="images/Student_manager_6.gif" alt="Receipts Print Preview" />

<p>Upon printing the sheet(s), they can be cut into handouts for each individual student 
to receive. When the print preview is closed, the receipt printed value for each student 
will be updated automatically.</p>

<p>Attempting to print receipts for students who have not yet paid or had a receipt 
printed already will trigger a message box to confirm your selection. Receipts can still 
be printed but it is recommended to amend the data for each student first.</p>
