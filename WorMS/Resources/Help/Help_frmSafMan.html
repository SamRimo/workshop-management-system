<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Upon starting the program for the first time or after changing the folder for where program 
data is stored, you will likely be presented with the following message box.</p>

<img src="images/Test_records_manager_2.gif" alt="No records found dialog" />

<p class="note">NOTE: If the test records file was to be deleted or tampered with,
some or all records on the actual file could be ignored. Please see Troubleshooting for
more details if test records you have previously saved cannot be found.</p>

<p>On first use, you will be brought to an empty Pick Record list box ready for 
entering the first test record. Record information can be entered through the date selector 
and comments text box to the left side of the window. Click the Calendar icon in the date 
selector to navigate and select any date in the past up to the current date.</p>

<img src="images/Test_records_manager_3.gif" alt="Input record" />

<p>Clicking Add will save the record on file and it will appear in the Pick Record list 
box on the right. Selecting one record will reveal its information on the left but you 
will not be allowed to change it. It can, however, be removed by clicking Remove.</p>

<img src="images/Test_records_manager_4.gif" alt="Select record" />

<p>In order to add a new record upon selecting an existing one, click Clear on the left 
of the window; the record selection will be cleared as well as the existing data from the 
Select Record section on the left.</p>

<p>Clicking Print Blank Sheet(s) on the bottom-right will trigger an input box to enter 
the number of blank sheets to print, which will be the number of copies of a single 
blank sheet sent to the printer. Headers in the sheet include lines for the date of check, 
the staff signature and the comments/action required for each test.</p>

<img src="images/Test_records_manager_5.gif" alt="Pages to print input box" />

<p class="note">NOTE: Clicking OK at this point will send the documents to the printer 
directly without a print preview. For a reference to what the sheets look like, check 
the blank lines in the Selected Test Records report print preview below.</p>

<p>Selecting multiple test records in the Pick Record list box by dragging the mouse over 
them or by holding Ctrl and selecting records individually will disable the left section since 
multiple records cannot be all viewed or removed collectively.</p>

<img src="images/Test_records_manager_6.gif" alt="Select multiple records" />

<p>The records are, however, able to be printed together in a Test Records report with 
the date and comments/action required sections for each record filled in automatically. 
A line will still be printed for the staff signature for each record 
to be wrote once printed. Any empty space below the page will be filled in with lines 
under the same headers for entering further records if required.</p>

<p>All records will be sorted in chronological order, opposite to how they are sorted in the 
Pick Record list box.</p>
