<h1>Requisition Form Manager</h1>

<img src="images/Requisition_form_manager_1.gif" alt="Requisition Form Manager window" />

<p>This form is used to manage saved requisition forms. The type of form can either be a 
draft, unprinted final or printed final form, all of which have their own unique differences.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Select type radio buttons (printed, unprinted, drafts)</b> - used to select a 
	certain type of form and display it in the requisition form list</li>
	<li><b>Requisition form list</b> - used to display the requisition forms saved under 
	the category selected above; forms are always sorted in chronological order</li>
	<li><b>Reuse/Change button</b> - used to open the currently selected requisition form 
	for editing through the <a href="Help_frmReqEdit.html">Requisition Form Editor</a></li>
	<li><b>Export to Excel button</b> - used to copy the contents of the currently selected 
	requisition form to an Excel spreadsheet formatted for printing as an actual requisition
	form; this will only work with unprinted final or printed final forms</li>
	<li><b>Remove button</b> - used to delete the currently selected requisition form</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Upon clicking Drafts as the requisition form type, a list of all the saved draft forms 
will generate.</p>

<p>Clicking a form in the list will enable the Change and Remove buttons below, 
which let you make changes to the selected form or remove it completely. Draft requisition 
forms cannot be exported to Excel and must be saved again as final to do so.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: When a form is saved again after opening it in the Requisition Form 
Editor, the original form will be kept alongside the new one created. Items in the list will 
always be sorted in chronological order so the old form can be easily found in the list, 
selected and deleted manually.</p>

<p>Upon clicking Unprinted as the requisition form type, a list of all the saved unprinted 
final forms will generate.</p>

<img src="images/Requisition_form_manager_3.gif" alt="Unprinted requisition form selected" />

<p>Clicking a form in the list in this mode will enable all the buttons below, allowing you to
not only reuse or remove the selected form but also export it as an Excel document, formatted 
as a requisition form for actual use. Just like with draft forms, after selecting Reuse and 
saving the form in the Requisition Form Editor again, it will create a copy of that form alongside 
it.</p>

<p>Clicking Export to Excel will trigger Microsoft Excel to generate a formatted requisition form, 
which will be saved to the user's documents folder. If the form was exported successfully, a 
message box will open which also states the location where it was saved.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: Your computer must have Microsoft Excel installed to do this. If you do not 
have it installed, the program will likely crash.</p>

<p>The exported form can then be viewed by opening the file through Microsoft Excel. For parts 
that may not fit properly, such as the item name in this case, the font size can be changed 
manually to accompany this.</p>
