# WorMS (Workshop Management System) #
This is my A-Level Computing programming project created in 2014 and developed in Visual Basic .NET.

Developed for a client at a local sixth form college to manage parts of their workshop used in their Design & Technology department.

### Features: ###
* Resource Manager - used to track, add, change and remove resource stock in the workshop
* Requisition Form Editor and Manager - used to create new and change or reuse existing requisition forms, with a facility to manage saved requisition forms
* Supplier Manager - used to manage suppliers for usage in requisition forms and track their usage
* Student Manager - used to manage student records and the resources they have used
* Machine Test Records Manager - used to add and manage records for weekly machinery safety testing, as well as to print blank record sheets for writing records onto paper for typing up later
